# Identify-Customer-Segments

**Identify-Customer-Segments** is a demonstration of using unsupervised machine
learning to identify the target customer base of a company. This is achieved
using data cleaning and feature engineering techniques, **principal component analysis (PCA)**
and **Kmeans** clustering. The datasets used are real demographics of the general
population of Germany and the current customer demographics of the company. The
result is the identification of segments of the population that are the companies
target customer base and segments of the population that are outside of the
companies customer base. With the age range, gender, average income, general location,
personality types and other useful information about the target customer base,
the company can then direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have
the highest expected rate of return.

### Techniques Used

- Data exploration and manipulation using Pandas

- Feature scaling and data imputation
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- K-means clustering unsupervised machine learning
